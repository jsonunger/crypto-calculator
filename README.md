# Vue 3 + TypeScript + Vite

Demo project that takes in a USD amount as holdings and calculates the 70/30 split for BTC and ETH, built using Vue 3, TypeScript, and Vite.

There are certainly some best practices in Vue that I don't know yet, but I tried to build things in a way that aligned with the documentation.
